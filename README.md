# Crystal Collector
Background - The Crystal Collector Game tests the player's memory and mathematical skills. Utilizing JavaScript random number generators, each crystal is given a value. Players do not know this value - but each time they click the crystal their score is increased by the value of the crystal. The goal is for the Player to exactly hit a randomly selected target value using a combination of the crystals. This algorithm is developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
